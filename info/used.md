**How it is used:**

The median has usage for Statistics and Probability theory, it has especially significant value for skewed distribution.
Here's an example: we want to know the average income of people from a set of data and
100 people earn $100 in month while 10 people earn $1,000,000. 
If we average it out we get $91,000. This is weird value and does nothing to show us the real picture.            
In this case the median would give to us more useful value and a better picture.
